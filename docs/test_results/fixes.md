## go-01-episode-recording.md

- [ ] go-01 #1 dead gift config — OPEN: needs a decision on whether `events.json` `PLAYER_GAVE_GIFT` (joy 0.15, intensity 0.2) should be removed or wired up. The quest layer writes the gift episode itself from `items.json` `base_trust_value`, so honouring the events.json values would change the trust and joy a gift produces, which the quest tests pin down.
