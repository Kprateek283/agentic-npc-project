# Fix ledger

The record of every finding reported under `docs/test_results/` and what was
decided about it. One line per finding.

Key: `[x]` fixed · `[ ]` open, needs a decision · `[-]` not a defect

## go-01-episode-recording.md

- [ ] go-01 #1 dead gift config — OPEN: needs a decision on whether `events.json` `PLAYER_GAVE_GIFT` (joy 0.15, intensity 0.2) should be removed or wired up. The quest layer writes the gift episode itself from `items.json` `base_trust_value`, so honouring the events.json values would change the trust and joy a gift produces, which the quest tests pin down.
- [-] go-01 #2 masked over-revocation — NOT A DEFECT: an observation about how far the handler tests reach, not wrong behaviour; `memory.RevokeForgiveness` is correct today and `memory_test.go` is the right place to guard it.
