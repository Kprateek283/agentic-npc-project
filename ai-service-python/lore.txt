Entry on the Mindbloom Petal:
The Mindbloom Petal is an exceptionally rare flower that blooms only under the light of a blue moon in the Whispering Caves. It is said to have restorative properties for the mind, not the body. Legends claim it can mend fractured thoughts and restore lost memories. The petal is incredibly fragile and will turn to dust if touched by any metal. It must be harvested with a tool made of polished obsidian or bone.

Entry on the Glimmering Trowel:
The Blacksmith, Baelor, is the only person in the village who knows the ancient technique of crafting with obsidian. The Glimmering Trowel is a small, sharp harvesting tool made from a single piece of volcanic glass, polished to a mirror finish. The crafting process is difficult and requires a pure heart and steady hands. Baelor is a good man, but he has grown suspicious of outsiders since the last merchant caravan brought trouble to the village.

Entry on the Twin's Curse:
The story of Elian and Lian is a sad one. Born under the same blue moon that makes the Mindbloom Petal bloom, it is said that Elian was blessed with a sharp and brilliant mind, while Lian's was left as a quiet echo. The Herbalist believes the Mindbloom Petal is the only hope to restore balance to Lian.
